To run the simulation:
*)Open Terminal
*)Run 'Python run.py'

# the simulation will run for 100 step ( one can change it in simulation.py and in the class simulation in model.py)


**Don't forget to install python / flask 
There is 2 type of simulations 
*) Normal Simulation :accessible by only running the code 
*)Browse simulation: Uncomment the commented part in the simulation.py part comment the designed part

The reason we set it as normal is to watch carefully every single step with clarity

In the terminal you will see the advancement of each agent along with their chosen actions in the end there s a summary(Metrics) to witness the performance of agents
