# Running the Simulation

## Instructions
To run the simulation:
1. Open Terminal
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

## Prerequisites
**Don't forget to install Python / Flask**

## Types of Simulations
There are two types of simulations:
- **Normal Simulation**: Accessible by simply running the code.
- **Browse Simulation**: Uncomment the commented part in `simulation.py` and comment out the designed part.

The reason for setting it as normal is to carefully observe every single step with clarity. 

In the terminal, you will see the advancement of each agent along with their chosen actions. In the end, there is a summary (Metrics) to assess the performance of the agents.
